**Installation:**

1. Clone the ChromaSpectra repository using Git: `git clone https://github.com/ewhu/ChromaSpectra.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ChromaSpectra`
3. Install dependencies using npm: `npm install`
4. Build the project using: `npm run build`

**Configuration:**

* **Environment Variables**:
	+ `CHROMASPECTRA_COLOR_SPACE`: Specifies the default color space for color conversions and transformations (e.g., `LAB`, `RGB`, etc.).
	+ `CHROMASPECTRA_SPECTRAL_ENGINE`: Configures the spectral processing engine, selecting from available algorithms (e.g., `fft`, `dft`, etc.).
* **Settings**:
	+ `colorDatabase`: Specifies the path to the color database file (e.g., `colorDB.json`).
	+ `performanceOptimization`: Enables or disables high-performance computing optimizations.

**Usage:**

ChromaSpectra provides a comprehensive API for color analysis and processing. Below are a few examples:

* **Color Conversion**: `import { convertColor } from 'chromaspectra'; const labColor = convertColor('#FF0000', 'RGB', 'LAB');`
* **Color Distance Calculation**: `import { calculateColorDistance } from 'chromaspectra'; const distance = calculateColorDistance(labColor1, labColor2, 'CIE94');`
* **Spectral Analysis**: `import { analyzeSpectrum } from 'chromaspectra'; const spectrumAnalysis = analyzeSpectrum(colorSpectrum, 'fft');`
